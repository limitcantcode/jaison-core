# Thanks for the support!

This project is open for contribution to improve the robustness and flexibility of existing systems.

If you have found an issue, please file an issue.

If you want to make changes, please make a pull request from your forked changes. Be descriptive in what you are changing and reference relevant filed issues if any. Start your title with the type of change it is in []. For example: `[fix] Fixed leak in OpenAI T2T`

I will not be accepting changes that involve breaking changes to the API or major topics I haven't explored in my videos yet. If you think the API needs a change or have a feature suggestion, please file an issue or let me know in my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Z8yyEzHsYM).
